The process of curating community held artifacts and digitizing this collection along with 206 Zulu's current stockpile will protect the ability of the items to continue to tell the rich story of the contributions of members of a diverse range of cultures and communities to the story of art in the Pacific Northwest.This project was created to center marginalized histories. 

OurStory focuses on musicians, artists and contributors, especially people of color, who've made significant impacts to the cultural landscape in the region but are virtually undocumented outside of their respective mediums. Our goal is to provide an outlet for cultural bearers to tell their own stories.

Many studies in the field of psychology support the power of creating new forms of media that include representation of people less visible in popular media sources. Dating back as far as the 1960's, we can evidence academic works such as George Gerbner's Cultivation Theory, a communications and sociological framework which posits that long-term exposure to media shapes how the consumers of media perceive the world as well as conduct themselves in life (Nabi & Riddle, 2008). Modern media often fails to reflect the realities, let alone show images of successful people in many demographics that exist in our society. For example, in a recent report from Lemish & Johnson (2019), which examined North American children's (up to age 12) television content, certain distinct disparities in representation were found such as:
Only 38% of characters were women or girls, while almost 51% of the US population is female (U.S. Census Bureau).
One percent of characters had any sign of physical disability or chronic disease, while 20% of the population lives with a disability (Okoro, Hollis, Cyrus, & Griffin-Blake, 2018).
Two percent of characters were portrayed as having lower socioeconomic status, when about 20% of children in the U.S. live below the poverty line (NCCP).

This footage includes people of color from a wide array of communities that make up the fabric of our region, including people from First Nations as well as individuals from all sides of gender and sexual orientation spectrums. Video footage documenting people from these groups hosting events, directly relaying historical facts, performing live art, telling their own stories through interviews and dramatic representations, and much more. The impact of the sights and sounds represented in this growing collection on the narrative of a diverse community of cultural contributors cannot be understated.",3,"The panel believes the intent of the project is very strong, though its implementation is relatively unclear.

Densho's board is currently 100% POC and the majority of Densho's staff are Japanese American, many being descendants of WWII incarceration survivors.

Unlike traditional archives that are often removed from the communities whose materials they preserve, we are a cultural institution in which preserving personal records and providing a platform for people of color to tell their own stories and access their own history is a top priority. Our audience feels a strong sense of ownership in Densho and sees themselves reflected in our work because they are at the center of our foundational materials and part of the dialogues that inform our decision-making process. 

By thoroughly documenting and understanding the history of Japanese American incarceration, Densho brings awareness and clarity to how structural racism works against communities. Densho is vocal about other racial injustices that resonate with Japanese American history, including but not limited to: mass incarceration, racially motivated civil rights violations, institutional and individual discrimination, media bias, and infringements of constitutional rights. Our support has included public events produced in partnership with targeted communities; educational curriculum; producing articles, blog posts, media outreach, and social media that use historical arguments to speak out against contemporary racial injustices; and hiring artists to create artwork that promotes racial justice. This grant will allow us to preserve the story of Densho's founding as a grass-roots, community based project, as well as our partnerships with other organizations that help us dive deeper into our commitment toward advancing equity.

The James & Janie Washington Cultural Center (JJWCC) is unique to Seattle - a fully preserved home, studio and garden created by an African American couple living in Seattle's CD from 1944-2000. This district, the historical center of Seattle's Black heritage and history, is a formerly redlined neighborhood that has experienced multiple waves of gentrification and displacement. Once 80% African American, the CD is less than 10% Black in 2023. 

The JJWF collaborates with a consortium of Central District Arts & Culture organizations to preserve the CD's history and relevance, and support action that stresses the importance of reclaiming Black space, Black land ownership and community organization in gentrified communities. 

JWCC collaborates with Arts & Culture organizations, governmental, community, and business entities, and individual artists working to preserve, document and reclaim the history of the neighborhood as a center of Black culture, by creating/managing projects that retain the district's community and cultural heritage. 

The Historic Central Area Arts & Cultural District, located in this historically Black community is an umbrella organization partnering with the James & Janie Washington Cultural Center, Northwest African American Museum, Langston Hughes Performing Arts Institute, Black Heritage Society of Washington State, Meredith Mathews YMCA, Central District Forum for Arts & Ideas, Africatown Development, Wa Na Wari, and Garfield High School Super Block.

The Arts District designation recognizes the cultural neighborhood undergoing rapid change, recognizes the cultural legacy and seeks to preserve its character while stimulating a growing arts environment for Black culture in the Central Area.

Seattle based African American newspaper, The Northwest Enterprise, describes the Jackson Street music scene in its article from 12 October, 1933, ""[I]t attracts persons from all sections of the city and numerous migrants who are attracted by the bright lights and other allurements. And there are allurements, if you know where to find them Jackson Street might well be called the Poor Man's Playground. Here all races meet on common ground and rub elbows as equals.

Prompted by distaste for vice, as well as their own racist sentiments, city officials and police began to take action against Jackson Street clubs' illicit activities, and police raids increased during the Depression.

The performances, lyrics, music, and history of this collection is a direct reflection of how African American + Black communities, in King County created joy, community, and art from both the community they created and the opposition it faced.

America's first bonsai masters were first-generation Japanese immigrants. Racial discrimination limited their work and educational opportunities, so many worked as gardeners and farm laborers, doing bonsai as a hobby. Those who established nursery businesses suffered significant losses with the signing of Executive Order 9066, which excluded anyone of Japanese descent from living in the Western States. In the barbed-wire detention camps, Japanese American incarcerees successfully grew bonsai in arid desert environments with limited resources, improvised tools, and makeshift containers. After the War, the pain and betrayal of incarceration led some bonsai artists to limit outsiders' access to their formal bonsai groups, while others saw a growing interest in bonsai as an opportunity for healing and began teaching anyone who wanted to learn. So began the practice and proliferation of bonsai in America.

Significant contributions to bonsai history in America were made by King County bonsai artists. In Seattle, Hiromu, Kelly, Nishitani's father, Denjiro, established a garden business on Ravenna Way and later passed on the business to his son, Kelly. He went on to become a key bonsai teacher in the Puget Sound region. The Oriental Garden Center nursery was co-founded in Federal Way by brothers-in-law Joe Asahara and Ken Hikogawa, who famously taught Japanese joinery to George Nakashima at Minidoka. The iconic bonsai that stood outside the Garden Center for 57 years--the Asahara hemlock--was donated by family members to Pacific Bonsai Museum in when the Garden Center closed in 2017.

Takeyuki Taki Nagasawa was born in Seattle in 1915 to a truck farmer in Woodinville who grew fruit for regional markets. Nagasawa helped run the family farm until 1942 when the entire family was incarcerated, first at the Puyallup Assembly Center, and then at the Minidoka camp in Idaho. Like so many young men of his generation, Nagasawa answered the call of his country to fight; yet unlike most men, he enlisted while he was incarcerated and served in the 442nd RCT. In 1960, Nagasawa opened the Green River Nursery in Kent, WA, specializing in bonsai, and in 1973, he became a charter member of the Puget Sound Bonsai Association. In 1988, Nagasawa joined the acquisition team responsible for selecting the bonsai that formed the original collection of the Pacific Rim Bonsai Collection (now Pacific Bonsai Museum).

We have maintained relationships with the family members of Japanese American artists whose works are now in our collection. Their descendants still feel deeply connected to their relatives' trees but lack the horticultural knowledge of how to care for them.

When Immigration Act of 1924 was passed, the United States shut the door on Asian immigrants altogether.  However, during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's, the United States enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.  This legislation repealed the ban on Asian immigration and ended racist quotas for other countries.   Now, in the three generations since 1965, we are indeed becoming a nation of immigrants.  The goal of KAHS is to document this process in the Korean community at the grass roots level.
KAHS works to collect and preserve the stories of everyday Korean Americans because these are the stories that define Korean American identity.  In doing so, we are committed to telling these stories honestly and in a way that contributes to better understanding among Koreans, as well as the greater community.  Our commitment to social and cultural inclusion is clearly articulated in our Collection Care Policy Manual which states as follows:  

""KAHS is committed to free speech, intellectual integrity and social and cultural inclusion.  A primary goal is to include in our collection the widest possible representation of the Korean American community.  We believe that diversity of people and points of view enrich the intellectual environment of our community.   If objects in the KAHS collection reflect points of view born out of intellectual integrity and they meet our accession policy, they are included without regard to the popularity of a particular point of view or potential controversy.  We do this knowing that reasonable people can have honest disagreements about many aspects of the Korean American experience.    But we pledge to reach all decisions in an open and transparent manner -- faithful to the values of free speech, intellectual integrity and social and cultural inclusion.""

A new Accessibility Subcommittee has been added to our Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA) Committee in 2023, whose goal is to create cross-institutional support and communication for projects like this Oral History Transcript Project. 

Selection of the 45 digitized oral histories for transcript will prioritize stories from People of Color and those historically excluded from the narrative. 

While MOHAI will not be consulting with community partners to identify these specific stories, the Collections Department team will be using previously gathered feedback of community members, which identified stories that are missing in our two permanent exhibits 'True Northwest: The Seattle Journey and the Bezos Center' for Innovation. This feedback was gathered through 13 different evaluations that have occurred since 2017, including two focused racial equity evaluations (one for each exhibit). As a result, MOHAI's entire staff has engaged in racial equity training, reflection, and the development of a museum-wide workplan. Since 2020, the Library team has been using this community feedback and strategic priority to identify historically marginalized groups excluded from MOHAI's storytelling and in particular to guide priorities for acquiring new items to our collections, digitizing our collections like oral histories, and uploading items to our online collection pages. 

The ability to hire a Temporary Oral History Specialist will allow MOHAI to make significant progress on making oral histories from diverse and marginalized groups more accessible to King County immediately through our online collections. The updated permanent exhibits will allow every visitor who comes to our museum, including children from King County visiting on a field trip, to experience these histories directly from the people themselves. In addition to the power of hearing individuals speak their own stories, we know that past collecting practices have often not captured these histories, making the oral histories an even more valuable historic record.

Finally, having a permanent sustainable procedure established by the Temporary Oral History Specialist, which optimizes limited staff capacity and future volunteer support, will allow MOHAI to transcribe additional stories more easily from historically marginalized communities. Once uploaded to MOHAI'S online collections, the transcripts will also provide additional access points to these stories to the people of King County and our entire Puget Sound region.",4,"The panel believes that the application was strong and well-developed.

The NHS collection includes tools, maps, and household items used by generations of Newcastle coal mining families. There are Census Lists and Worker History card files kept by the Pacific Coast Coal Mining company. In 2020 we published a 172 page book that highlights the mines, workers and families who made up the mining towns of Coal Creek and Newcastle. Photographs, documents and company records show that miners came from 14 different European Countries as well as Black miners from Missouri, local Native Americans, Chinese and Japanese railroad workers, and second and third generation descendants of immigrants born in the United States.

Digitizing these records will make it possible for researchers to quickly find individuals, trace family histories, and understand the living and working conditions in the mining communities. In talking with recent immigrants they immediately express a feeling of commonality and welcome. We often hear comments such as these: ""My father and grandfather worked in the mines in our country. I know those tools we use them too!""

During recent History Table events, History Walks and tours of our Newcastle Cemetery a reconciliation of sorts happens as people of different racial & ethnic backgrounds realize that their ancestors shared the same hard work and life challenges. In spite of instances of racial discrimination during the mining days, mutual respect is built now by looking at our common history, and what our ancestors accomplished together. It is clear that underground and in the mining towns everybody eventually cooperated; their lives depended on it.

But were made by an corporation in another state that no longer exists.

This region has been home to the Coast Salish people since time immemorial. Their culture evolved with the surrounding environment as a new climate developed after the last ice age; enabling cultural practices that developed old growth forests & farming techniques that worked with the ecosystem's particular adaptations. Coast Salish people practiced timber harvesting techniques that allowed timber to be collected without killing the trees.

When early settlers arrived to the Northwest from the American east coast, Europe, & Asia; they found a land dense with trees, steep hillsides, & dampness most of the year. European & American settlers often viewed these forests as wild resources to be harvested and turned into farms as they knew them, not taking into account the seamlessness of indigenous timber and agricultural practices in the landscape.

American settlers began using a technique of cutting down the whole tree. Felled tree size, typically 15 in diameter & 250 tall, limited logging to areas with access to a river or lake where logs could be pulled a short distance by oxen & floated to a mill. 

The steam engine powered the growth of the railways & tree-harvesting, revolutionizing logging. Geared Shay-type steam locomotives allowed logs to be hauled from steep mountain valleys to mills & then with ease on railways to markets outside the Northwest. The industry of logging exploded, growing exponentially with steam power. 

Old forests disappeared, new people came, new structures appeared, & traditional land practices suppressed. New plants & animals were introduced to the land. The landscape of King County and Pacific Northwest was deeply changed, & growing in population & industry at a rapid rate. 

Additionally, the material helps tell part of the story of Japanese immigrants working in the logging & railway industries. The demand for railway and timber labor introduced numerous groups of immigrants to King County. Japanese immigrants worked for the lumber mills & built the rail line in the Snoqualmie Valley. Shay locomotives from Snoqualmie Falls Lumber Co operated on track built and maintained by Japanese & Japanese American railroad workers. 

The history of geared Shay-type locomotives in the Pacific Northwest is an essential component of understanding how our landscape was changed, and its effects on the indigenous peoples & subsequent immigrant groups who worked & settled here to the present day. 

We believe that many groups including Coast Salish, Japanese-American, & other cultural groups will wish to utilize the collection in the future to help tell their diverse stories about the impacts of the railways & the logging industries on their own communities.",N/A,N/A,2023 Collections Care Application Data

For example, RVHS' oral history program represents over 50 different heritages of individuals that have lived in Rainier Valley.

Members of the source community will indeed have a decision-making role in the project. The SGP is committed to fostering a collaborative and inclusive approach, ensuring that the community's perspectives, needs, and priorities are central to the decision-making processes. The project team will actively involve community members in planning, implementation, and management.

The SGP will establish community advisory groups and engage in ongoing consultations with community stakeholders. These advisory groups will include representatives from the historically marginalized communities whose heritage is being preserved. They will have a significant role in shaping the project's direction, making decisions about collection priorities, access, and use, and providing guidance on ethical considerations related to cultural heritage.

The SGP recognizes the importance of centering community voices and expertise in preserving and sharing their heritage. By actively involving the source community in decision-making processes, the project aims to ensure that their perspectives, values, and aspirations are honored and respected. This approach enhances the authenticity and cultural sensitivity of the project's outcomes and promotes a more equitable and inclusive representation of King County's diverse heritage.

Furthermore, the SGP will provide opportunities for community members to contribute their knowledge, stories, and experiences directly to the project. This could include participating in oral history interviews, sharing personal archival materials, and providing feedback on the project's outputs.

Historically underfunded & low income, it has long been under-served by civic resources. Members of the source community lead the museum and are involved in the decision-making process. 

The Museum's collection comes from within the community, typically from original owner's families. Artifacts are typically of European-American origin reflective of a 90-98% European-American population in the Valley circa 1890s to 2010s. Other artifacts are from the Snoqualmie Tribe & other Coast Salish groups reflective of the majority population since time immemorial until the 1890s & an significant population since. There are few artifacts from the Japanese-American community due to WWII incarceration which destroyed most Japanese community artifacts. 

The Snoqualmie Tribe & around two dozen US settler families & several dozen single men lived in the Valley prior to the arrival of the railway. After the arrival, nearly 2000 European-Americans arrived within a 3-year period. There were a few Chinese & Japanese-American settlers as well, but the Chinese Exclusionary act & the Chinese Massacre at Issaquah caused most of the Chinese-Americans to leave prior to 1900. The Japanese-American community grew to around 400 individuals by 1940 but they were forcefully removed during WWII. The European-American community grew to about 10,000 individuals by 1940. There was also a small Filipino community. Around a dozen African-Americans lived in the Valley for brief periods prior to 1940. Other ethnic backgrounds, until the 1980s, typically were small groups of single itinerant workers in the agricultural, timber, & railroad industries that by the nature of their employment unfortunately did not leave behind a strong record to preserve. A few individual families were also present from other ethnic backgrounds. Many individuals & families from backgrounds with multiple cultures historically identified as white or Native American within documents. 

We currently partner with the Snoqualmie Tribe on the interpretation of their history with the sduk albix: Snoqualmie Tribe exhibit that accounts for about 25% of our exhibit space. 

As our community demographics are shifting for the first time since the 1890s, we are finding ways to preserve materials from more recently arriving cultural groups & better incorporate new residents into our organization. Between 2010 & 2020 the demographics shifted from 90% European-American to 75% European-American in North Bend. The Museum does not hold many artifacts from those changing backgrounds though we would like to better tell their stories. Our current long-term exhibits focus on the Snoqualmie Tribe, Farming in the Valley (including Snoqualmie Tribe techniques and Hmong farmers in Fall City), & a 1910s parlor & kitchen display to interpret home life without electricity.

The Museum is a community-based, community-led arts and culture heritage museum, created in 1966 by AANHPI community members in direct response to cultural erasure in the context of exclusion and racism in the Chinatown-International District (CID). The Museum is currently led with staff and board of more than 80% AANHPI and mixed race. Ongoing exhibitions and education programming are created hand-in-hand with community members according to the Wing Luke Museum's community process, building community itself, furthering generational connections, and ensuring the continuation of authentic culture, rooted in the personal stories and lived experiences of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders in King County and beyond. As a place-based organization, the Wing Luke Museum serves as a cultural anchor and economic driver for the CID, one of Seattle's earliest neighborhoods and the home base, cultural beacon, place of belonging, and starting place for immigrant families for AANHPIs today. 

The CID neighborhood consists of 44% AANHPI, 19% Black, 3% Hispanic/Latinx, two or more races 6%, 30% below the poverty level, and 56% speaking a language other than English at home. More than 500 small businesses often struggle to survive in competition with nearby downtown developers. The neighborhood has been rated as at extreme risk for displacement in the City's 2035 Comprehensive Plan, even before COVID-19; now after years of closure and declines in revenue, the historic neighborhood has even more need of drawing visitors, attention, and economic activity to the neighborhood, and preserving heritage and culture. The CID was most notably recently named by the National Trust for Historic Preservation to its 2023 Top 11 Endangered Places, the first designation for a place in Washington State and pointing all the more to the need to protect and preserve cultural resources, such as the Woo Family Collection, related to it.

With our collections of more than 45,000 books, photographs, objects, and oral histories related to the AANHPI experience in Seattle and King County, we provide resources and programming to help illuminate the early history of our region, preserve the heritage and culture of AANHPIs, and promote understanding to advance racial and social equity.",5,"The panel believes this application is very thorough and compelling.
